            <b>Total courses :</b> 21 courses (Ranging from basic to the most advance levels. Hence, it works for
            anyone, from a collage student to an experience engineer)
            <b>Total 6 compulsory projects and 3 optional projects</b> as part of this program.
            <b>Coveted UpSkul PG diploma certification </b>after completing all test, project and assignments.
            This <b>6 month (self paced)</b> program is divided into four stages and each stage achieves a specific
            learning goal, these are discussed below,
            <br><b>Stage 1: Introduction,</b><br>
            Student to have a basic idea of the program curriculum vehicle architecture, R&D environment, their role and
            more confidence to choose his or her specialization.
            <br><b>Stage 2: Intermediate,</b><br>
            After completion student can design most general components (brackets, hose, panels etc.), select materials,
            draw and able to finalize his or her specialization.
            <br><b>Stage 3: Advance (I)</b><br>
            After completion student can design all major components within the BIW and closure subsystem and carry out
            general design engineering activities for concept to prototyping.
            <br><b>Stage 4: Advance (II)</b><br>
            Student has extensive in-depth knowledge of BIW and closure function group, relevant child domains and
